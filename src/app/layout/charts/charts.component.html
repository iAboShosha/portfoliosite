    <p>Here is a sample of sales dashboards included in the library I built (mostly) of over 5,000 reports, dashboards and KPIs:</p>
    <h2><strong>Top Performers</strong></h2>
    <p>Shows top sales this year. We also have this for quarter and month.</p>
    <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11531" src="assets/dscharts/Top-Sales-and-GP-This-Year.png" alt="top-sales-and-gp-this-year" width="923" height="843" srcset="https://dataself.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Top-Sales-and-GP-This-Year-300x274.png 300w, https://dataself.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Top-Sales-and-GP-This-Year-768x701.png 768w, https://dataself.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Top-Sales-and-GP-This-Year.png 923w"
            sizes="(max-width: 923px) 100vw, 923px"></p>
    <h2><strong>Ship To – by Customer</strong></h2>
    <p>The user searches/selects a customer from the drop down list, and query shows their sales in the same month in the last 2 years. Red colors indicate that there’s a sales decline comparing to last year. This can be helpful to address declining sales
        and see why certain regions are doing better than others. We have similar dashboards by product and salesperson.</p>

    <h2><strong>Customer Trends&nbsp;</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Similar to the dashboard above. The rep can select a customer and:<br> See sales trends by month<br> See which products have declining sales from the same period last year. If the rep is in a call with the client, the rep can investigate reason
            for sales declines.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have similar dashboards by product and salesperson.</p>

    <h2><strong><br>

    <h2><strong><br>

    <h2><strong><br>
Moving Averages</strong></h2>
    <p>Is it important to monitor moving averages? Dashboards like the one below will help you monitor moving averages in different parts of your business. It’s easy to change the period included in the report as well as the period to calculate the moving
        average (such as avg among 3, 6 and 12 months).</p>

    <h2><strong>Top Sales Last QTD vs This QTD</strong></h2>
    <p>This allows the monitoring of how top performers in the last QTD are doing in this QTD. Ideally, they are doing better now. These dashboards cover dimensions such as Salesperson, Customer, Product and ShipTo.</p>

    <h2><strong>Sales and Gross Profit Scatter Plots</strong></h2>
    <p>These dashboards can show outliers or trends that might not be so obvious. In the example shown here, Salesperson=Ingrid has a profitability way below than everyone else.</p>
